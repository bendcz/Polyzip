## üöÄ About

Polyzip is a program written in C11 for **compressing and decompressing files** using the following algorithms:

- RLE (Run-Length Encoding),
- Adaptive Huffman (Faller-Gallager-Knuth),
- LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch).

Polyzip tries to adhere to **simple**, **secure** and **tested** code.

## üî® How to Build

**Dependencies:**

- CMake (3.30 >=),
- OpenSSL (3 >=),
- Criterion (for tests only).

Compiling the project is very easy. Follow the steps below!  
In your CLI:

1. `git clone git@github.com:bendcz/Polyzip.git`
2. `cd Polyzip`
3. `mkdir build && cd build`

Then, you have three choices.
1. **Compile in Release mode (with optimizations and without debug possibilities):**
    - `cmake .. && make`
2. **Compile in Debug mode (without optimizations and with debug possibilities):**
    - `cmake .. -DDEBUG=ON && make`
3. **Compile unit tests:**
    - `cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON .. & make`

### Usage

In CLI: `./polyzip -<c|d> -<ALGORITHM> <INPUT_PATH> <OUTPUT_PATH>`,

* `-c`: compression,<br>

* `-d`: decompression,
* `-rle`: using the RLE algorithm,
* `-huffman`: using the Huffman algorithm,
* `-lzw`: using the LZW algorithm,
* `<INPUT_PATH>`: path to the file to compress/decompress,
* `<OUTPUT_PATH>`: directory where the result should be written.


## üõ°Ô∏è Security

I tried to produce secure code, in particular by using functions with more safeguards (such as the buffer size in `snprintf`)  
and by checking the various use cases with Valgrind. The pattern of the command is:

```
valgrind --leak-check=full \
         --show-leak-kinds=all \
         --track-origins=yes \
         --verbose \
         --log-file=valgrind-out.txt \
         ./polyzip -<c|d> -<ALGORITHM> <INPUT_PATH> <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure you've compiled in debug mode before you expect to see anything!**

I have also set up a CodeQL analysis for the repository. However, if you ever find a flaw in this code, you can contact me

## üí° To-Do List

- Implement the DEFLATE algorithm,
- Store *magic codes* in files to remember the original format,
- Compile the executable for the main operating systems,
- Make unit tests more robust and improve code coverage,
- Creating a graphical interface with the SDL.
