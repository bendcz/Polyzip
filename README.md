## ðŸš€ About

Polyzip is a program written in C11 for **compressing and decompressing files** using the following algorithms:

- RLE (Run-Length Encoding),
- Huffman (adptative),
- LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) (TODO),
- DEFLATE (TODO).

Polyzip tries to adhere to **simple**, **secure** and **tested** code.

## ðŸ”¨ How to Build

**Dependencies:**

- CMake (3.30 >=),
- Criterion (for tests only),
- OpenSSL (for tests only).

Compiling the project is very easy.  
In your CLI:

1. `git clone git@github.com:bendcz/Polyzip.git`
2. `cd Polyzip`
3. `mkdir build && cd build`
4. `cmake .. && make`

To active test compilation, `cmake ..` should be `cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..`.
